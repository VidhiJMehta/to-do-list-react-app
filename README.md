## Looking Forward
Here are some improvements that I wish to make on this project: 
* Improving the spacing between the buttons + making some styling changes
* Increasing the width of the viewable input and task fields
* Adding Copyright to the webpage
* Change the background to be a motion/animated background
* Using Bootsrap to add minor animations to the app
